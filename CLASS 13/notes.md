Topic =====> Props and React Hooks i.e Usestate

props always flow from parent to child
parent component : your present component where you pass your data form  
child component : your component that is render and where your data is passed to

problem statement : for differnet data in components we use props

function keyword can allow export default at start and end
but in arrow function we only export default at the end

always use template literals when using ts in html like using props form parent to child i.e bgColor in button classname

Topic ====> Figma 2 code:

select Navbar in figma design
left side : figma design sections
right side : section css properties

to use your custom value in tailwind CSS we use arbitary value denoted by []
line height = leading
letter spacing = tracking

Homework
copy figma into your code
