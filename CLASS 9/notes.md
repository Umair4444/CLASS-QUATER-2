AGI - Artifical General Intelligence ==> match human intelligence and can do multitasking and be a multi-actor
do tangible and non-tangible task.it is not limited to any task but can do any task. It is advanced form of AI
It is theoretical possible.

Singularity ==> talk about Ai grey area and can do task beyond human capabilities. It is hypothetical and is far more advanced and can go out of control.It can learn on its own.

grey area ==> is out of control and uncontrol area

ANN -- Artifical Neural Network ==> learn intelligence like human
Types ==> 1.ANI Artifical Narrow Intelligence 2.AGI ==> Artifical General Intelligence

Sam Altman is founder of OpenAI and say we cannot directly achieve AGI but through steps
open AI define its steps
there are five levels of AGI:

==>1.Chatbots ====> Directflow and Siri are direct flow natural language
     1.NLP--Natural language Processing 2.NLU--Natural level Understanding NLG--Natural languauge Genration
     Chatgpt4.0 gemini-google1.5flash Antropic-sonic opensource-lama3.2 metaAI copilot
     Quick Thinking and Quick Reasoning ===> we are pre-trained and we decision on the history of the profile
     This is System 1 thinking 
    
==>2.Thinking or Reasoning Processing time -- Deep Analysis====> if quick reasoning doesnot take me final decision and I will run
     a background
     check and complete history check and then come to a decision.
     Chain of thoghts is giving time to perform complex and give best reply and perfomance
     training is when you are learning and infernece when you are performing task and this is called computing
     inference time computing -- o1-preview 
     o-1 has learn all information on internet till 2023.
     This is System 2 thinking.

==>3.AI Agents or Agentic AI ===> Gardener say 2025 is year of Agentic AI
    level 1 ==> when NLP NLU and NLG is achieve.
    level 2 ==> when reasoning and thinking before giving you answer.
    level 3 ==> Maturity level be responible and complete task and have best LLM.

    Agent is a virtual human and can take autonomous decision.
    It is multi-threading and can be clone and can do task simultaneously.
    Agent can be humanoid or a software.

    1.Understand means good listener and use five of your senses and use and understand the data to the best of your ability.
    2.Think means thinking before making decision acooring to your resources
    3.Act means do action 

    Parent ===> Instruction ===> Babysitters ===> look after child
    Developer ===> Data and prompt ===> AI Agents ===> Execute Task

    Developer gives instruction through prompt and data and authentication all given by developer

    Agent is software on the backend make through LanGraph 

    Interaction ==> work flow make by LANGraph (write,speak,button)
    Backend ===> workflow and manage by AI agent


    25 years ago those make apps are now Unicorn Company
    apps are made to solve problems
    apps donot have LLM autonomous and personalize
    Agents wiil be more than humans

    Workflow is make by Langraph 

    App is App on internet
    Agent is Agents on LLM to solve problem 

    AI Agents make stuff done and 

==>4.Innovation ==> means AI agents make new and better improvements and inventions using AI Agents 
Not achieve yet

==>5.Organization ==> means autonomous organization including humans and AI Agnets manage by AI Agent
control fully by AI

frontend ==> nextjs 
server ==> LanGraph tells what to do
LLM provide intelligent
Graph Database ==> Graph Query language 
hybrid Interface ==> graphics-interface + conversational-interface
gpt 4o-with canvas
Claude 3.5 sonet manage by Amazon AWS
