ROUTES HANDLERS:

WE CREATE OUR OWN API
api/folder-name/route.ts it is essential to create api

METHODS FOR API
1.GET
2.POST
3.DELETE

calling api is always a async task not beacause it takes time beacause it fetch data from server
change localhost to vercel when deploying api --- **\***

when we hit get method our data is cached till nextjs 14
caching is next server sve data in its memory
caching is good when data is not changing frequently

2. Post method
   if we make a chat application we make input field to submit form

client/frontend/browser
server/backend/api

1.frontend --> post-request --> made a form --> build method to submit

when we submit form page refreshes and entire data removes
